                    <button class="accordion"><b>Do I need to be an accountant, bookkeeper to use the software?</b></button>
                    <div class="panel">
                    <p>
                        If you are an accountant or bookkeeper then yes.
                        Jokes aside, the answer is no. Like we mentioned before, 
                        this software was developed with non-accountants in mind, so using it shouldnâ€™t be a problem at all.
                    </p>

                    <button class="accordion"><b>I can't seem to login with my user name and password, what can I do?</b></button>

                    <p>In case you are not able to login, you can try contacting the managing staff @: biz@stenden.com</p>
                    <p>In the message explain your login issue and dont forget to input your product key</p>

                    <p>
                        <p>On some systems, quite rarely, this issue can appear.</p>
                        <p>All that you have to do is to just install the newest update and it should fix the issue,</p>
                        <p>don't forget to backup your data.</p>

                    <button class="accordion"><b>Our antivirus notifies me that this software contains malicious software after every update</b></button>
                    <div class="panel">
                    <p>We asure that this software contains no viruses of malicious software of that nature. 
                        This prompt appears only on older systems with old antivirus software. The only thing that we can suggest is just to ignore
                    the notifications. And unblock the file if your antivirus has blocked it.</p>
